# Dance Party

## Project Overview
In this project you will create a animation that moves within the boundaries of the screen. 

## Objectives

- [ ] Add code to a method in a given skeleton class
- [ ] Use methods from the Graphics class.
- [ ] Use the color class
- [ ] Use variables to manage data and expressions to calculate the position of your
shapes.

## Specifications

Create an animated dance party. Your dance party should include at least one avatar (or object) which should move in various ways (back and forth, across the screen, up and down, wave a hand, etc). The dance party should include a variety of shapes and colors (these can move too). Your dance party should also include a message (Yo Yo, Woo Hoo, Rar, etc.).

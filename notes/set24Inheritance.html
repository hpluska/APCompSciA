        <p><strong>Inheritance</strong> is an important pillar of OOP(Object Oriented Programming). 
            It is the mechanism in java by which one class is allow to inherit the features(fields and methods) of another class.</p>

            <p><strong>Important Terminology</strong></p>
            <ul>
                    <li><strong>Super Class</strong>: The class whose features are inherited is known as super class(or a base class or a parent class).</li>
                    <li><strong>Sub Class</strong>: The class that inherits the other class is known as sub class(or a derived class, extended class, or child class). 
                        The subclass can add its own fields and methods in addition to the superclass fields and methods.</li>
                    <li><strong>Reusability</strong>: Inheritance supports the concept of “reusability”, i.e. when we want to create a new class 
                        and there is already a class that includes some of the code that we want, we can derive our new class from the existing class. 
                        By doing this, we are reusing the fields and methods of the existing class.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The short video below provides an overview of this concept</p>

<div id="skill2" class="skills">Skill 24.2 Implement inheritance using the keyword <strong>extends</strong></div>
<div class="skillConceptsHeader">Skill 24.2 Concepts</div>
<div class="skillConcepts">
<p>The keyword used for inheritance is extends.</p>
    <div class="codeblock"> 
        <p>class derived-class extends base-class  </p>
        <p>{</p>  
        <p>//methods and fields</p>     
        <p>}</p>    
    </div>

<p>In the below example of inheritance, class Bicycle is a base class, class MountainBike is a derived class which extends Bicycle class and class Main is a driver 
    class to run program.</p>

    <iframe height="600px" width="100%" src="https://repl.it/@hpluska/Set25Skill2?lite=true" scrolling="no" frameborder="no"

    <p>In the above example, the Bicycle class is refered to as our Superclass. The MountainBike class is referred to as our Subclass.  
        By using the work "extends" in the MountainBike class, the MountainBike class inherits all the methods and state variables of the Bicycle class.

<div id="skill3" class="skills">Skill 24.3 Implement the constructor of a super class using the keyword <strong>super</strong></div>
<div class="skillConceptsHeader">Skill 24.3 Concepts</div>
<div class="skillConcepts">
<p>As previously mentioned, the keyword <strong>extends</strong> causes a subclass to inherit all the methods and state variables of its super class.  This is also true for the constructor. </p>
<p>To invoke the constructor of a super class the keyword <strong>super</strong> is used. This concept is illustrated below. </p>
<img src = "../images/inheritance.png">


<p>There are some significant features of inheritance illustrated above. In the absence
        of super(gear, speed), the MountainBike constructor would have tried to automatically call the
        Bicycle constructor and would have failed, since the Bicycle constructor requires two
        parameters and we would not have supplied these. By making super(gear, speed) the first line of code,
        we are able to supply the needed parameters. When used, <strong>super()</strong> must be the first line of code in the
        constructor of the subclass.

<p>
    Because the MountainBike class extends the Bicycle class, MountainBike is able to access all the public methods and variables associated with Bicycle.   
    This concept is illustrated below,

<div id="skill5" class="skills">Skill 24.5 Create objects from super and sub classes</div>
<div class="skillConceptsHeader">Skill 24.5 Concepts</div>
<div class="skillConcepts">
<p>The inheritance of one class from another follows an "IS A" relationship.  That is, a mountain bike "IS A" bicycle.  The reverse is not true however.  For example, a bike is
    not necessarily a mountain bike.  When creating objects from super and sub classes, this relatioinship becomes important. 
</p>
<p>Consider the following hierarchy of inherited classes between bicycles</p>
<img src = "../images/inheritanceRelationships.png">

<p>The above heirarchy shows the relationship among the classes in a program.  According to the heirarchy 
    <ul>
        <li>CrossCountryBike "IS A" MountainBike</li>
        <li>DownhillBike "IS A" MountainBike</li>
        <li>MountainBike "IS A" Bicycle</li>
    </ul>
</p>

<p>When creating objects from super and sub classes this relationsihp is enforced.  This is illustrated below,
</p>
<img src = "../images/inheritanceCreatingObjects.png">
<p>Another way to think of this is that "parents can make children, but children cannot make parents"</p>

<div id="skill6" class="skills">Skill 24.6 Pass a sub class object as a parameter</div>
<div class="skillConceptsHeader">Skill 24.6 Concepts</div>
<div class="skillConcepts">
    <p>Any time when a parameter is expecting to receive an object of a particular type, it is acceptable
            to send it an object of the same class or a subclass, but never of a superclass. This is because the passed class
            object inherits all the methods of the object. If you attempt to pass an object of a parent class, the expected object may not
            have all the expected methods. Consider the following hierarchy of classes where each class is a
            subclass of the class immediately above it.</p>
    <img src = "../images/inheritanceHierarchy.png">

    <p>Suppose there is a method with the following signature:</p>
    <div class="codeblock"> 
            <p>public void theMethod(Male ml)</p>   
    </div>
    <p>The method theMethod is clearly expecting a Male object; therefore, the following calls to this
            method would be legal since we are either sending a Male object or an object of a subclass:</p>

    <div class = "codeblock">
            <p>Male m = new Male();</p>
            <p>theMethod(m); //ok to send m since it’s expecting a Male object</p>
            <p>Boy b = new Boy();</p>
            <p>theMethod(b); //ok to send b since b is created from a subclass of Male</p>
    </div>
    <p>Since theMethod is expecting a Male object, we can’t send an object of a superclass.</p>
    <div class = "codeblock">
            <p>Person p = new Person();</p> 
            <p>theMethod(p); //Illegal</p>
            <p>theMethod((Male)p); //Legal if we cast p as a Male object</p>

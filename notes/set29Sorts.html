            The Selection Sort uses an incremental approach to sorting. 
            During the first pass the smallest value is selected from 
            the entire array and swapped with the first element. 
            On the second pass the smallest value is selected from the array 
            beginning with the 2nd element and swapped with the second element, 
            etc….the above description is for an ascending sort.

<div class="skillConcepts">
<p>An insertion sort also uses an incremental approach.  With an insertion sort,
    the array can be thought of as consisting of two parts, a sorted list followed
    by an unsorted list.  The idea behind an insertion sort is to move elements from 
    the unsorted list to the sorted list one at a time. As each item is moved, 
    it is inserted into its correct position in the sorted list.  In order to 
    place the new item, array elements need to be shifted to create a slot.

<div class="skillConceptsHeader">Skill 29.3 Concepts</div>
<div class="skillConcepts">
    <p>Selection and insertion sorts are inefficient for large n, requiring approximately
        <em>n</em> passes through a list of <em>n</em> elements.  More efficient algorithms
        can be devised using a "divide-and-conquer" approach, which is used in the merge sort
        algorithm.
    </p>
    <p>The Merge Sort uses the divide-and-conquer approach. It begins by placing each element 
        into its own individual list. Then each pair of adjacent lists is combined into one sorted list. 
        This continues until there is one big, final, sorted list. The process is illustrated in the video below.</p>

<div class = "skillConcepts">
    <p>The quick sort uses divide and conquer to gain the same advantages as the merge sort, 
        while not using additional storage. As a trade-off, however, 
        it is possible that the list may not be divided in half. 
        When this happens, we will see that performance is diminished.</p>

    <p>A quick sort first selects a value, which is called the pivot value. 
        There are several different ways to choose the pivot value, 
        <ul>
                <li>pick first element as pivot</li>
                <li>pick last element as pivot</li>
                <li>pick a random element as pivot</li>
                <li>pick median as pivot</li>
        </ul>
    The role of the pivot value is to assist with splitting the list. 
    The actual position where the pivot value belongs in the final sorted list, 
    commonly called the split point, will be used to divide the list for 
    subsequent calls to the quick sort.</p>



    <p>This concept is further illustrated in the video below.</p>

<p class = "skillTakeAway">The quicksort algorithm is a sorting algorithm that sorts a collection by choosing a pivot point, 
        and partitioning the collection around the pivot, so that elements smaller than the 
        pivot are before it, and elements larger than the pivot are after it. It continues to 
        choose a pivot point and break down the collection into single-element lists, 
        before combing them back together to form one sorted list.</p>

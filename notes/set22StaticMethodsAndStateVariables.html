    <p>Static methods are sometimes called <em>class methods</em>. Similarly, static
    instance fields (static state variables) are called <em>class variables</em>. The reason for the class
    designation is that when we access either static methods or variables, we are accessing them at
    the class level rather than at the object level. (In this course, we will primarily use the word
    static rather than class as the designation of such methods and variables).</p> 

    <p>A static method is one type of method which doesn't need any object to be initialized for it to be called. 
    Have you noticed <em>static</em> is used in the main function in Java? Program execution 
    begins from there without an object being created. </p>

<div class="skillConceptsHeader">Skill 22.2 Concepts</div>
<div class="skillConcepts">
        <p><strong>The first reason for using static:</strong></p>
        <p>We are accustomed to calling a method or accessing a data member 
            (state variable) by first creating an object and then using that object to 
            reach the method or variable. In the following example, 
            if we want to call a method or access 
            abc from outside the Nerd class, 
            here is how we have had to do it in the past,</p>
        
        <iframe height="500px" width="100%" src="https://repl.it/@hpluska/Set23Skill21?lite=true" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" allowtransparency="true" allowfullscreen="true" sandbox="allow-forms allow-pointer-lock allow-popups allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-modals"></iframe>
        <p>Now, we are going to show how to do this without having to create an object. 
            This will require a slight rewrite of the Nerd class.</p>

        <iframe height="500px" width="100%" src="https://repl.it/@hpluska/Set23Skill22?lite=true" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" allowtransparency="true" allowfullscreen="true" sandbox="allow-forms allow-pointer-lock allow-popups allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-modals"></iframe>
        <p>Notice that we did not need to create an object this time. 
            Rather we used the name of the class.
                (That's why they're sometimes called class variables and methods).
        <p>While this may seem weird, we have done this before! 
                    Remember our usage of Math.PI? Math
                is a class within Java and PI is a static data member there. Because it is static we can access it
                without first creating an object.</p>
        <p>So, there you have it, the first reason for having static variables and 
                    methods:</p>   
        <div class="skillTakeAway"><p>The static designation allows you the ability to access variables and methods without
                        having to create an object</p></div>
        <p>Finally, while we are on this topic, we are now able to see why static is present in the familiar,
                public static void main(String args[]) signature. It is because we are accessing the main method
                from the “outside world” without creating an object.</p>

        </div>
        <p><strong>The second reason for using static:</strong></p>
        <p>We will now examine a class with static state variables and see what happens when we create
                        various instances of this class. (Notice that is the same as saying we create various objects from
                        the class.)</p>
        <iframe height="500px" width="100%" src="https://repl.it/@hpluska/Set23Skill23?lite=true" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" allowtransparency="true" allowfullscreen="true" sandbox="allow-forms allow-pointer-lock allow-popups allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-modals"></iframe>
        <p>The above illustrates another principle of static data members. That is, they are shared by all
        instances (all objects) of that class. In fact, the static variables are still present and available even
        if no objects are ever instantiated.  </p>

<div id="skill3" class="skills">Skill 22.3 Access methods and data members from within a static method</div>
<div class="skillConceptsHeader">Skill 22.3 Concepts</div>
<div class="skillConcepts">
        <p>If from within a static method we try to access another method and/or data member of the same
        class, then that other method and/or state variable must also be static. This is illustrated by the
        following code:</p>
        <iframe height="400px" width="100%" src="https://repl.it/@hpluska/Set23Skill3?lite=true" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" allowtransparency="true" allowfullscreen="true" sandbox="allow-forms allow-pointer-lock allow-popups allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-modals"></iframe>
       
        <p>From the above example, we can draw the following conclusions,</p>
        <div class="skillTakeAway"><p><ul>
        <li>Static methods can reference only static variables and never the “regular”, non-static
        instance variables.</li>
        <li>Non-static methods can reference either.</li></ul></p>

    <div class="skillConcepts">
        <p>Recall constants are variables that have a constant (unchanging) value. Constants can also be
            static as demonstrated in the following example,</p>
            <p class="code">public static final double PI = 3.14159;</p>
